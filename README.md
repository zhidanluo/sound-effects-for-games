# Generation of Non-Repetitive Sound Effects for Games

## Introduction
The use of high-quality sound effects is growing rapidly in games, multimedia and other interactive
virtual environments. Pre-recorded versions of these sounds are used to generate sound effects in
real time and offline productions. This method requires a large set of recordings of these sounds
to cover all possible situations. Play-back of pre-recorded samples obviously appears simple and
fast, however one of the biggest problems when using pre-recorded sound effects is the
monotonous repetition of these sounds which can be tedious to the listener. The aim of this topic
is to develop new algorithms that will generate non-repetitive sound effects using parameters from
user self-defined.

## Requirements
- matplotlib <br/>
- numpy <br/>
- peakutils <br/>
- scipy <br />
- pywt <br/>
- sklearn <br/>

## Instruction

- Samples used in the code is 'TIC-fing-50.wav'.
- Defalt wavelet is chosen to be 'db5'.
- Vary *bandwidth* to obtain different audio.
- Other samples are available under the file 'sound_samples'.
- **DON'T FORGET TO SET CORRECT PATH.**
